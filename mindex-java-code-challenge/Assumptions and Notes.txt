NOTES:
1. I had the issue stated below with gradle and spring boot which prevented me from launching the application. I documented what I did to resolve it so I could proceed.
2. For task 2 I assumed Date would be sufficient for the effectiveDate field.
3. For task 2 I attempted passing in an employee object for the compensation API endpoint but it wasn't working, so I changed compensation to take and hold the employeeId rather than the entire employee object. 
When making a request, pass in the compensation object as {employeeId, salary, date}:
	{"employeeId": "16a596ae-edd3-4847-99fe-c4518e82c86f", "salary":"50", "effectiveDate":"2022-04-16"}

> startup failed:
  General error during semantic analysis: Unsupported class file major version 61

  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 61

CAUSE:
The gradle version of the project was not correct for the local version of Java I had installed -- 17.2. I needed to change the version of Java or Gradle I was using so that they would be compatible.

SOLUTION:
Update the gradle-wrapper.properties distributionUrl to be a gradle version that is supported by the version of Java I have.
  - distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3-bin.zip.
